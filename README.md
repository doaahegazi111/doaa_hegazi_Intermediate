## task1:
You are given an array of integers, and you need to write a function that finds the two largest numbers in the array. Your function should take an array of integers as input and return an array containing the two largest integers in descending order. If the array contains less than two integers, your function should return null.

*Example1*: given the array [5, 2, 9, 8, 7], your function should return the array [9, 8].

*Example2*: given the array [1], your function should return null.

## task2:
You are given an array of strings, and you need to write a function that finds the longest string in the array. Your function should take an array of strings as input and return the longest string. If the array contains no strings, your function should return null.

*Example1*:  given the array ["apple", "banana", "pear", "kiwi"], your function should return "banana".

*Example2*: given the array [], your function should return null.

##  task3:
You are given an array of integers, and you need to write a function that finds the sum of all the positive integers in the array. Your function should take an array of integers as input and return the sum of all the positive integers. If the array contains no positive integers, your function should return 0.

*Example1*:  given the array [1, -2, 3, 4, -5], your function should return 8.

*Example2*: given the array [-1, -2, -3], your function should return 0.

##  task4:
Create a basic calculator.

*Description:*

You need to create a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator should have a user interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

*Requirements:*

- The calculator should have a display area where users can see the numbers and the result of the calculation.
- The calculator should have buttons for each digit from 0 to 9, as well as buttons for the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The calculator should have a "Clear" button that allows users to clear the current calculation.
- The calculator should have an "Equals" button that allows users to perform the calculation and see the result on the display area.

**Note** that the JavaScript code for the calculator will involve handling button clicks and updating the display area with the appropriate values. You can use JavaScript functions to handle arithmetic operations and store the current calculation in variables.
